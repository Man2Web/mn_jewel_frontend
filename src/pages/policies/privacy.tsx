          </p>
          <p>
            We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information
            when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
            Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site
            functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for
            analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to
            your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences).
            The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and
            services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
          </p>
          <p>

            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
            or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information
            for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
            from any further processing until deletion is possible.

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to

            secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of

            within a secure environment.

            that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the
            Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
            will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If
            you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at{' '}

            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
            when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
            on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

            <strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our

            we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT

          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard
            for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
            browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
            If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
            that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

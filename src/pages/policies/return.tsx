        We have a 14 day return/exchange policy, which means you have 14 days after receiving your item to request a
        return/exchange. Once the return/exchange is approved it will be delivered in 7-10 business days. To be eligible
        for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in
        its original packaging. Youâ€™ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
